        'Tridacna crocea are beautiful clams oftentimes displaying a variety of colorations with intricate patterns. These clams are also referred to as Crocea Clam, Boring Clam or Crocus Clam, and are the smallest of all Tridacna spp., reaching a maximum size of 6" in the wild. The Crocea Clam can penetrate through limestone substrates by releasing an acid to break down the carbonate in the stone. It uses the ridges of its thick shell to dig into the rock by opening and closing quickly through the use of its large byssal muscle, giving the clam the common name "boring clam." This burrowing behavior helps to protect it from predators such as sea stars, along with Angelfishes, Butterflyfishes, and other reef dwelling species that consume bivalves.',

The shell of this clam is very thick with prominent ribs, and has reddish blotches making it easy to differentiate from other clams. The mantle of these clams does not extend past the edge of the shell, and are brownish-green to gray in color with faint gold stripes. The large opening in the mantle, which is called the incurrent aperture, lacks the tentacles that are common with other clams within the Tridacnidae family. These are relatively fast growing clams that process a lot of water for their size which helps in controlling nutrients in a reef aquarium.",

The numerous rows of large scales over its entire shell are often used as shelter by other organisms, such as small crabs, other clams, and other invertebrates. The shell is symmetrical, and the matching growth pattern in its shell allows it to close together very tightly when it needs to. The Squamosa Clam is often found living amongst Acropora coral, anchored by its byssal filaments. It has a wide byssal opening and long tentacles surrounding its incurrent siphon. The Squamosa Clam can grow up to 12 inches or larger in the home aquarium.",
